# Gas_App
A gas app designed to help everyday people save some money by finding the best stations.

Disclaimer *This app was not forged in the fires of Mordor but we do believe in creating one app to rule them all. 

Inspired by the real life struggles of our college experiences we are seeking to create an app that can help the money strapped,
time pressed, procastinating individuals like ourselves decided once and for all "Is it worth it?". When time is money and money 
is time and your in college you have D) None of the above. We know this to be true because well... #TheStruggleIsReal and we can
vouch for that. That is why we are designing this app. If you only have $10 and twenty minutes we want to help you decide if it's
worth it to drive the extra mile or two. Not that you can't figure it out on your own, it's the whole "only having twenty minutes"
bit because who has time to call every local fuel station to ask for prices before actually making that trip to refuel? But like 
we said, we understand. That's where our app comes in. You simply tell us your MPG so that we can tell you if that extra mile is 
really going to be worth it. The worth is factor is calculated by taking the distance of the fuel station, your MPG and current
prices and figuring out which location is going to give you the most bang for your buck. You can also search based on alternative
criteria such as distance or price alone. But we leave that up to you.
